<h1 style="text-align:center;">History</h1>
<p><font color="black"> <size= 2px>During the middle ages in Europe,
	a new style of art was emerging.  Gothic Art.  
	The art style emerged from Romanesque art.
	It was mostly used and seen in architecture, such as famous cathedrals and churches. 
	Slowly, the Gothic art style was spreading across Western Europe, 
	including South and Central Europe. </font></p>
<H2 style="text-align:center;">Artists</h2>
	<p><font color="black"><size= 2px> Many artists turning to the Gothic art style were Italian and French. 
	This could possibly have came from the rise of Gothic literature of the time.  Many writers were turning to secularism
	as their genre of writing.  This sparked an interest among artists themselves, and outrage from the church. 
	Artists began to form trade guilds in which they could keep better records of their work.  Some brave artists would even
	dare to put their name on their artwork.  Soon enough, these artists were being commissioned.
	Among the famous Gothic artists were: 
<ul>
	<li>Cimabue (1240-1302)</li>
	<li>Duccio di Buoninsegna (1255-1319)</li>
	<li>Giotto (1266-1337)</li>
	<li>Simone Martini (1284-1344)</li>

<H3><font color="red">Architecture</font></h3>
	<p> Gothic architecture has three distinguishing factor: the pointed arch, the ribbed valut, and the flying  
	buttress.  The arch itself was derived from early Muslim architecture in the Near east.  The ribbed vaults 
	were adopted from the Romanesque Era, allowing architects to build higher cathedrals.  The ribbed vaults are
	characterized by continuous arches of heavy columns forming the ceiling.  To support all this weight,
	architects built structures on the outside of the buildings, protruding from the side of the building to 
	the floor level, called buttresses.  In 1093, The first building to incorporate all three of these distinguishing
	parts was the Durham Cathedral in North England.

	<p><font color="black"><size= 2px>Early Gothic art has greatly influenced modern gothic art and the style is still prevalent in many aspects. 
	Artists are still insprired by the use of gargoyles, architectural and religious features that were found in many architectural feats.  
	Gothic style has made its appearance in music as well.  Punk and alternative music have Gothic roots, with characteristics consisting of heavy-music,
